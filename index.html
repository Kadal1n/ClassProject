	<p>Hey! Thanks for dropping by my website. My name is Lucas and this page will serve as an introduction to me and
		some of my hobbies/interests as well as providing a way for me to practice web design.</p>
	<p>I grew up in the rainy state of Washington on the West Coast of the United States. As a kid in a small town my
		friends and I got up to all the usual shenanigans you might expect. Some favorite memories of mine are summer
		days spent riding around on our bikes down to the river or lake to spend the day fishing, the night was then
		spent playing video games or watching movies. In the winter I could be found skiing in Whitepass or Mt. Hood
		whenever possible.</p>
	<p>After graduating high school in 2008 I joined the Air Force and have hardly been home since. I am currently
		stationed in Germany for the second time, I have also been stationed in the UK, California (where I met my
		wife), and Turkey. We hope to retire somewhere in the Pacific Northwest so hopefully my last assignment will
		take me that direction. Aside from that, I have a pretty wide variety of interests. I enjoy going to music
		festivals, painting miniatures, and traveling in general. </p>
	<p>Since Covid has come around I have spent more time on the web than ever before. Here are a few websites that I
		frequent, some hobby related, some just to kill time.

	<ol> <a href="Youtube.com">YouTube</a> can be educational or you can spend 5 hours watching battle rap wondering how
		you got there. <br>
		<a href="Reddit.com">Reddit</a> has forums dedicated to any topic under the sun. <br>
		<a href="twitch.tv">Twitch.tv</a> used to just be a few people streaming Starcraft 2 and has since grown into
		platform for users to stream themselves as they play anything from music to video games or even chess.
	</ol>
	</p>
