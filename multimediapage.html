    <p>So you want to go to a camping music festival but aren't sure what to
        bring? Maybe you just want some tips in general? Have no fear... I have
        created a one stop shop to answer all that and more!

    <p>Of course when you're deciding what to pack you need to consider not only the weather, but whether or not you're
        going to be "camping", or "glamping". Camping is just about what you would expect, sleeping in a tent on the
        ground with a couple fold out chairs plus a cooler for your beverages of choice. </p>
    <p>For those of you drawn to the finer things in life (and with the cash to burn) "glamping" or "glamorous camping"
        might be more your style. Many festivals offer packages that include all sorts of amenities even including tents
        with air conditioning in some cases.</p>
    <p>Whatever you decide, just come ready to have a good time (and bring lots of water!)</p>
